# MS-Rasomware
I have developed a ransomware that incorporates various techniques to effectively carry out the malicious attack. The ransomware utilizes a privilege escalation method to obtain elevated privileges, and contains a range of functionalities including a sandbox escaper, communication with a command and control server, hybrid encryption and decryption algorithms, a message box displaying payment details, and more.

One of the key features of this ransomware is its use of a silence privilege escalation method, which allows it to bypass security measures and gain elevated privileges without the need for user interaction or authorization. This technique enables the ransomware to execute its malicious code with increased privileges, making it more difficult for security software to detect and prevent its actions.

Additionally, the ransomware employs a sandbox escaper which allows it to evade detection and analysis by security software that operates in sandboxed environments. The communication module of the ransomware is designed to interact with a command and control server, which enables the attacker to issue commands and receive updates from the infected systems.

The encryption and decryption functionalities of the ransomware are based on hybrid algorithms, combining both symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques to achieve a high level of security. This ensures that only authorized individuals with access to the private decryption key are able to recover the encrypted data.

Furthermore, the ransomware includes a message box that is displayed to the victim, which provides instructions on how to make the ransom payment and includes details such as the amount of ransom demanded, the deadline for payment, and the payment method. This feature is intended to intimidate and pressure the victim into paying the ransom, by highlighting the severity of the consequences of non-payment.

It should be noted that the development and use of this ransomware is strictly for educational purposes only, and any use of this tool for malicious or illegal purposes is strictly prohibited.
